2.1.2.10 Direct Memory Access (DMA) Registers
  The pair of DMA registers, DMAU and DMAL, is used to specify and issue a DMA command. 
A DMA command specifies the transfer of a contiguous block of data, up to 4 KB, 
between the locked cache and external memory. 
Each DMA command consists of the starting address in locked cache, 
the starting address in external memory, 
the length of the transfer in cache lines, and the direction of the transfer.

  The DMA facility is enabled using the HID2[LCE] bit. 
When HID2[LCE] = 0, the mtspr and mfspr instructions can be used to read and write the DMA registers, 
but the DMA commands associated with these registers are ignored. 
In particular, the DMA_T and DMA_F bits in DMAL are always forced to zero in this mode. 
When HID2[LCE] = 1, a mtspr to DMAL with the DMA_F bit = 1 causes the DMA command queue to be flushed, 
otherwise a mtspr DMAL with the DMA_T bit = 1 causes the DMA command specified in the DMA registers to be added to the DMA command queue.

  Figure 2-16 and Figure 2-17 show the format of the upper and lower DMA registers.
