2.1.2.10 Direct Memory Access (DMA) Registers
  The pair of DMA registers, DMAU and DMAL, is used to specify and issue a DMA command. 
A DMA command specifies the transfer of a contiguous block of data, up to 4 KB, 
between the locked cache and external memory. 
Each DMA command consists of the starting address in locked cache, 
the starting address in external memory, 
the length of the transfer in cache lines, and the direction of the transfer.

  The DMA facility is enabled using the HID2[LCE] bit. 
When HID2[LCE] = 0, the mtspr and mfspr instructions can be used to read and write the DMA registers, 
but the DMA commands associated with these registers are ignored. 
In particular, the DMA_T and DMA_F bits in DMAL are always forced to zero in this mode. 
When HID2[LCE] = 1, a mtspr to DMAL with the DMA_F bit = 1 causes the DMA command queue to be flushed, 
otherwise a mtspr DMAL with the DMA_T bit = 1 causes the DMA command specified in the DMA registers to be added to the DMA command queue.

  Figure 2-16 and Figure 2-17 show the format of the upper and lower DMA registers.

9.2 Locked L1 Data Cache 
Under the control of the HID2[LCE] bit, the L1 data cache can be configured as either a 32-KB normal cache, 
or as a 16-KB normal cache and a 16kKB locked cache. The locked cache can be explicitly managed, separate from the normal cache. A new instruction, dcbz_l, is used to allocate cache lines in the locked cache.

9.2.1 Locked Cache Configuration
At power-on or reset, HID2[LCE] is set to be 0. The L1 data cache is a 32-KB 8-way set-associated cache, as 
described in Chapter 3. When a mtspr instruction sets HID2[LCE] = 1, the data cache is configured as two 
partitions. The first partition, consisting of ways 0-3, is a 16-KB normal cache. The second partition, 
consisting of ways 4-7, is a 16-KB locked cache. The normal cache operates as described in Chapter 3, 
except that it behaves as a four-way set-associative cache. The operation of the locked cache partition is 
described in the following sections

9.3 Direct Memory Access (DMA)
750CL implements a DMA engine to transfer data between the locked L1 D-cache and the external memory. 
The DMA engine has a 15-entry FIFO queue for DMA commands and processes the commands sequentially. 
The DMA engine’s operation is controlled by the two special purpose registers: DMAU and DMAL.

9.3.1 DMA Operation
The DMA engine is disabled at power-on with HID2[LCE] = 0. Setting HID2[LCE] = 1 partitions the L1 Dcache and enables the DMA engine. Note that after HID2[LCE] is set to 1, the i-cache must be invalidated 
prior to executing any dcbz_l instructions. Also, for systems which generate snoop transactions, HID2[LCE] 
shall be kept at 0.
When a mtspr instruction sets DMAL[T] = 1 and DMAL[F] = 0, the DMA engine latches the values in DMAU 
and DMAL to form a DMA command, enqueues the command in the DMA queue and sets DMAL[T] = 0. 
HID2[DMAQL] indicates the number of DMA commands in the DMA queue, including the command in 
progress (if any).
When the DMA queue is not empty, i.e., HID2[DMAQL] ≠ 0, the DMA engine processes the commands 
sequentially. The starting address of the transfer in the D-cache is DMAL[LC_ADDR] || 0b00000. The starting 
address of the transfer in the external memory is DMAU[MEM_ADDR] || 0b00000. The number of cache lines 
to be transferred by a command is DMAU[DMA_LEN_U] || DMAL[DMA_LEN_L], except that a value of zero 
specifies a length of 128 cache lines. The direction of the transfer is determined by DMAL[LD]. DMAL[LD] = 0 
means a transfer from the locked cache to the external memory. DMAL[LD] = 1 means a transfer from the 
external memory to the locked cache

For a DMA store command, i.e., DMAL[LD] = 0, the DMA engine performs a D-cache look-up for each of the 
cache lines sequentially from the starting address. For a look-up hit in the locked cache, the DMA engine 
initiates a 60x bus write-with-flush transaction to transfer the 32 byte cache line from the locked cache to the 
external memory. 
For a DMA load command, i.e., DMAL[LD] = 1, the DMA engine performs a D-cache look-up for each of the 
cache lines sequentially from the starting address. For a look-up hit in the locked cache, the DMA engine 
initiates a 60x bus burst read transaction to transfer the data from the external memory to the locked cache. 
For all but the last read transaction associated with the DMA load command, the burst read transaction type 
is 0b01011. The last burst read transaction has a transaction type of 0b01010. 750CL initiates the burst transaction type 0b01011 only for the DMA load commands. The memory controller can use the information to prefetch the next cache line to improve the performance.
The DMA access to the cache, either a load or a store, will result in a pseudo-LRU state transition within the 
four-way set associated with the cache line, but does not affect the MEI state. If the look-up misses the locked 
cache, the DMA engine transfers no data and continues to the next cache line. 
The eieio and sync instructions have no effect on the DMA engine. 
The only way to flush the DMA queue is to issue a mtspr instruction to set DMAL[F] = 1. In this situation, the 
DMA engine flushes all the commands in the DMA queue, including the command in progress, and sets both 
DMAL[F] = DMAL[T] = 0. Such an instruction should be followed by a sync instruction to ensure that the 
pending bus transaction associated with the discarded command, if any, complete before the DMA engine 
accepts the next DMA command
